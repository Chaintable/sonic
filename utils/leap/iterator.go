// Iterator defines a generic iterator over a sequence of ordered elements of
// type T. It is a general abstraction of a data source that can be utilized
// by the algorithms in this package.
type Iterator[T any] interface {
	// Next advances the iterator to the next element. Initially, the iterator
	// is positioned before the first element, so Next must be called to advance
	// it to the first element. Next returns true if the iterator was advanced
	// to a valid element, and false if the iterator is exhausted.
	Next() bool

	// Seek advances the iterator to the smallest element greater than or equal
	// to the given target value. It returns true if such an element was found,
	// and false if the iterator is exhausted. If exhausted, the iterator
	// points to the position after the last element, invalid for Current.
	//
	// Backward seeks are not supported. If the seek target is less than the
	// current element, the iterator is not moved (i.e., Seek is a no-op in
	// that case).
	Seek(T) bool

	// Current returns the current element. It must only be called after Next or
	// Seek has returned true.
	Current() T

	// Release releases any resources held by the iterator. It must be called
	// when the iterator is no longer needed.
