// GetBundleInfo implements the `sonic_getBundleInfo` RPC method, which retrieves
// information about the execution of a transaction bundle.
//
// Since bundles are not stored in the blockchain like regular transactions,
// this method provides information about bundles executed in the recent past.
// The sonic client is not capable of tracking bundles indefinitely, and may return
// null for bundles executed too far in the past.
//
// In the same fashion as `eth_getTransactionReceipt`, this method returns a
// non-error response with null payload if the bundle hasn't been executed yet.
//
// If the bundle has been executed, it returns the block number, position of the
// first transaction of the bundle in the block, and the total number of transactions
// that got included in the block due to the execution of the bundle.
